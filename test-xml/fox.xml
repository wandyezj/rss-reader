      <title>Judge orders Hunter Biden to look for a job, lay off drugs as conditions for staying out of jail</title>
      <description>As conditions for staying out of jail, Hunter Biden must abstain from drugs or alcohol, submit to random drug testing, and not possess a firearm.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Delaware on Wednesday ordered &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/hunter-biden" target="_blank"&gt;Hunter Biden&lt;/a&gt; to "actively seek employment," abstain from drugs or alcohol, submit to random drug testing, and not possess a firearm as conditions for staying out of jail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The conditions were laid out by U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/trials" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing trial&lt;/a&gt; in Delaware centering around the first son. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-sugar-brother-lawyer-spotted-smoking-bong-home-balcony-visit-presidents-son" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUNTER BIDEN'S ‘SUGAR BROTHER’ SPOTTED SMOKING BONG ON HOME BALCONY DURING VISIT FROM PRESIDENT'S SON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hunter Biden was charged last month with two misdemeanor crimes of failure to pay more than $100,000 in taxes from over $1.5 million in income in both 2017 and 2018. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The younger Biden had been expected to plead guilty Wednesday after he made an agreement with prosecutors who were planning to recommend two years of probation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6331882788112" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE FAILED HUNTER BIDEN PLEA DEAL IS A PROBLEM OF THE DOJ'S MAKING: JONATHAN TURLEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the plea deal collapsed Wednesday during a court hearing after Judge Noreika raised concerns about the terms of the agreement and her role in the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plan also included an agreement on a separate gun charge — Biden has been accused of possessing a firearm in 2018 as a drug user. As long as he adhered to the terms of his agreement, the gun case was to be wiped from his record. Otherwise, the felony charge carries 10 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The overlapping agreements created confusion for the judge, who said the lawyers needed to untangle technical issues — including over her role in enforcing the gun agreement — before moving forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Wednesday Hunter Biden remains under active investigation, but would not reveal details. In the meantime, Hunter Biden &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-plea-deal-appears-fall-apart-first-court-appearance" target="_blank"&gt;pleaded not guilty&lt;/a&gt; to the tax charges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-shuts-down-questions-collapse-hunter-biden-plea-deal" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHITE HOUSE SHUTS DOWN QUESTIONS ON COLLAPSE OF HUNTER BIDEN PLEA DEAL: ‘I DON’T HAVE ANYTHING TO SHARE'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The collapsed proceedings were a surprising development in the yearslong investigation, and a resolution that had been carefully negotiated over several weeks and included a lengthy back-and-forth between &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department" target="_blank"&gt;Justice Departmen&lt;/a&gt;t prosecutors and Biden's attorneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plea deal was meant to clear the air for Hunter Biden and avert a trial. Republicans, meanwhile, are insisting the first son got a sweetheart deal in which the Democratic president's son got off easy while the president's rival, former President Donald Trump, has been unfairly castigated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"District Judge Noreika did the right thing by refusing to rubberstamp Hunter Biden's sweetheart plea deal," said House Oversight Committee chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky. "But let's be clear: Hunter's sweetheart plea deal belongs in the trash."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has reached out to Hunter Biden’s legal team for comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Suspected Long Island serial killer to be prosecuted by Suffolk County DA</title>
      <description>Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney will prosecute the Suspected Long Island serial Killer Rex Heuermann, according to an announcement on Wednesday.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Suspected Long Island serial killer &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/gilgo-beach-murders" target="_blank"&gt;Rex &lt;u&gt;Heuermann&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be prosecuted by Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Heuermann&lt;/u&gt; is charged with six counts of murder: one count of first degree murder and one count of second degree murder for each of the three victims. The victims have been identified as Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tierney, who's the lead prosecutor in Heuermann's case, took office in January 2022 and began his career in 1992, according to a statement from his office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"He intends to prosecute this case fully and bring justice to the victims of this alleged serial killer. In addition, the DA’s office will continue to work with our Task Force partners to develop new evidence and prepare the case for trial," the statement reads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/suspected-long-island-serial-killers-duck-hunting-could-have-been-perfect-cover-hiding-bodies" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUSPECTED LONG ISLAND SERIAL KILLER'S DUCK HUNTING COULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT COVER FOR HIDING BODIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heuermann pleaded not guilty to all charges during a court hearing earlier in July.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the charges were filed, Heuermann's wife, Asa Ellerup, filed for a divorce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/rex-heuermanns-wife-pictured-first-time-files-divorce-gilgo-beach-serial-slaying-suspect" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;REX HEUERMANN'S WIFE PICTURED FOR FIRST TIME AS SHE FILES FOR DIVORCE FROM GILGO BEACH SERIAL SLAYING SUSPECT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Authorities said 11 sets of human remains were found on a beach highway in Long Island between 2010 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investigators continue searching Heuermann's Long Island home for &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime" target="_blank"&gt;additional evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/grim-tide-hunting-the-long-island-serial-killer/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WATCH: ‘GRIM TIDE’ ON FOX NATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heuermann is married and has two children, and was working as an architect in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Manhattan while&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; living on Long Island.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I'm an architect. I'm an architect consultant. I'm a troubleshooter. Born and raised on Long Island. Then working in Manhattan since 1987," Heuermann said in a February 2022 video interview with Bonjour Realty posted to YouTube. "When a job that should've been routine suddenly becomes not routine, I get the phone call."&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to how Hunter Biden's legal woes could accelerate an impeachment inquiry</title>
      <description>A formal Biden impeachment inquiry by House Republicans may be sooner than expected after Hunter Biden&amp;apos;s plea deal was dropped Wednesday.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The legal woes &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/hunter-biden" target="_blank"&gt;of Hunter Biden&lt;/a&gt; and today’s dropped plea deal likely accelerates the possibility of a formal impeachment inquiry by House Republicans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some Republicans were skeptical of launching any sort of inquiry – let alone &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank"&gt;impeaching the President&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-plea-deal-appears-fall-apart-first-court-appearance" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUNTER BIDEN PLEADS 'NOT GUILTY' AS PLEA DEAL FALLS APART DURING DELAWARE COURT APPEARANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But issues with the plea deal did nothing but pose more questions from Republicans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s why this likely spurs more serious conversation about impeachment inquiry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-appear-federal-court-enter-guilty-plea-out-years-long-federal-probe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUNTER BIDEN TO APPEAR IN FEDERAL COURT, ENTER GUILTY PLEA OUT OF YEARS-LONG FEDERAL PROBE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will be about the math.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The full House must vote to formally begin an impeachment inquiry. It’s fair to say that the House is a little closer to that now than it was before the Hunter Biden deal blew up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/long-time-biden-ally-prosecutor-us-attorney-weiss-office-hunter-probe-called-him-a-brother" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LONGTIME BIDEN ALLY WAS PROSECUTOR IN US ATTORNEY WEISS' OFFICE DURING HUNTER PROBE, CALLED HIM 'A BROTHER'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, voting to ESTABLISH an impeachment inquiry gives the House WIDE LATITUDE to go after more documents, information and conduct depositions. The Hunter Biden deal situation poses more questions than answers. &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate/republicans" target="_blank"&gt;So more Republicans&lt;/a&gt; may be inclined to pursue such a plan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meantime, Democrats seem to be caught off guard by the change with Hunter Biden’s deal. They were prepared to just dismiss this and move on. But they can’t anymore. So far, Democrats have presented &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/newsedge/politics" target="_blank"&gt;little cohesive strategy&lt;/a&gt; about how to deal with this turn events – and protect the president. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We could hear more about this Thursday and Friday as this is the last time until mid-September that the House will be in town. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Expect lawmakers to pepper &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kevin-mccarthy" target="_blank"&gt;House Speaker Kevin McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; (R-Calif.) about the next steps. And also, pose questions to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) about the defense Democrats may need to mount on behalf of the president.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Joe Biden is the 'big loser' in the collapse of Hunter's plea deal, some critics say</title>
      <description>Hunter Biden&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;sweetheart deal&amp;quot; imploded in Wilmington federal court on Wednesday, leading critics to predict much rougher seas ahead for the first son and his father.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Biden's continued denials of knowledge of and involvement in his son's business dealings will only become more scrutinized now that his son Hunter's "sweetheart" plea deal appeared to implode in Wilmington federal court, critics told Fox News on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said it is "extremely rare" for such a circumstance, comparing what happened in court to a wedding where the minister asks if any of the assembled object, and both the bride and groom do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In court, Trump-appointed Judge Maryellen Noreika asked Delaware federal prosecutor Leo Wise whether an ongoing investigation into the defendant still continues. Wise answered in the affirmative, but declined to elaborate, leading Biden attorney Christopher Clark to later disagree with the prospect of a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-plea-deal-appears-fall-apart-first-court-appearance" target="_blank"&gt;future FARA (Foreign Agent Registration Act)&lt;/a&gt; violation charge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At that point, the plea deal fell apart, as both Wise and Clark made comments to that effect and Noreika questioned the constitutionality of the original agreement. Hunter Biden ultimately pled not guilty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/wh-denials-joe-bidens-knowledge-hunters-business-deals-significant-shift-ex-prosecutor" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WH DENIALS OF JOE BIDEN'S KNOWLEDGE OF HUNTER DEALS TAKE ‘SIGNIFICANT SHIFT'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It's just weird because usually you work these things out in advance, but the judge has an obligation to make sure that the defendant and the government have a very clear idea of what is implicated here… and they clearly didn't have that agreement," Turley told "The Story."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turley said the current state of the case leaves Hunter in the worst possible situation, where he has no plea protection, and U.S. Attorney David Weiss can bring any or all remaining counts against him – including what would be weighty FARA allegations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hunter now faces a "real chance of jail time" if the feds go forward with the normal course of action in such cases, which is to bring all cogent charges to the table.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal editorial writer and former Bush speechwriter William McGurn also commented on the case, saying the plea deal relied on neither side, nor Noreika, asking pertinent questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/irs-whistleblower-willfulness-in-hunter-biden-case-set-his-apart-from-typical-civil-matters" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRS WHISTLEBLOWER: ‘INDEPENDENT ATTORNEY’ NEEDED IN HUNTER CASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said Wise's team had to say the case against Hunter is "ongoing" because that has been what has procedurally shielded Weiss and Attorney General Merrick Garland from responding to congressional inquiries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I think Hunter Biden, of course, is a real loser immediately. But I think Joe Biden is a big loser down the road," he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McGurn compared President Biden's tact regarding the case to that of John Banner's character in the popular 1960s sitcom "Hogan's Heroes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Every day there's more and more information in Congress casting doubt in his claims, the kind of ‘Sergeant Schultz defense’ -- I know nothing about [Hunter]."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banner's character, Luftwaffe Sgt. Hans Schultz, carried out a notably absent-minded job of guarding Allied prisoners at the fictional Stalag-13 POW camp in Germany, where he was often outsmarted by the prisoners' commanding officer, Bob Crane's US Army Col. Robert Hogan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whenever he was pressed on whether he witnessed hijinks or sabotage by Hogan's "heroes," he would adamantly respond "I know nothing."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McGurn said President Biden's "Sgt. Schultz defense" will likely take another hit next week when former Hunter business partner Devon Archer – facing a prison term on securities fraud charges – testifies about their foreign dealings in a transcribed congressional hearing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said Archer is expected to be asked whether Joe Biden was on speakerphone while Hunter discussed business, adding his ignorance defense then "becomes unsustainable."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rfk-jr-pledges-day-one-executive-order-prohibiting-bureaucratic-weaponization" target="_blank"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; is still not accepting reality. They've been let off the hook so far by few reporters are willing to press them," McGurn said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.com/download" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rep. Jason Smith, the Missouri Republican leading the House Ways and Means Committee with its probe into Hunter Biden, commented on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/dems-irs-whistleblower-hearing-couldnt-offer-counterargument-only-invoked-trump-george-floyd-critics" target="_blank"&gt;the IRS whistleblower&lt;/a&gt; facet of the first son's case, saying that they recently asked for cooperation in passing along their own findings to Noreika.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He rejected an assertion made on MSNBC by Obama-era Michigan federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade, who called such congressional involvement improper, and an attempt to influence proceedings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith said he received no cooperation from Garland or Weiss, and had to hire an attorney to work on the committee's behalf in the matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I would have to disagree with [McQuade] because in fact, this has happened numerous times: Members of Congress file amicus briefs all the time in different cases, both criminal and civil," he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Justice Department files injunction against Texas over floating border barrier in Rio Grande</title>
      <description>The DOJ filed a request for a preliminary injunction against Texas, which asks the state to remove the river barriers within 10 days at its own expense and with Amy assistance.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a motion for &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/justice-department-sues-texas-floating-border-barrier-rio-grande" target="_blank"&gt;a preliminary injunction against Texas&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday regarding the state's river barriers on the Rio Grande.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DOJ, which seeks to have the river barriers removed within 10 days at Texas's expense, filed the injunction as the case is being litigated. It is a proposed order that is within the judge's power to accept or reject.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The order would prevent Texas officials from adding any additional structures onto the Rio Grande without permission from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Army would also coordinate with the state to remove the barrier within 10 days, if the proposed injunction is accepted. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DOJ has &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas" target="_blank"&gt;lambasted the Lone Star State&lt;/a&gt; for the floating buoy barrier, arguing that it obstructs navigation and is unsafe for both migrants and the environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mexicos-amlo-intensifies-anti-gop-election-meddling-new-attack-texas-gov-abbott" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MEXICO'S AMLO INTENSIFIES ANTI-GOP MEDDLING WITH NEW ATTACK ON TEXAS GOV ABBOTT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The Floating Barrier also causes imminent irreparable harm because it obstructs lateral navigation across the Rio Grande for hundreds of yards along the river’s length," the DOJ argued in the proposed injunction. They also added that the government of Mexico disapproves of the structure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Mexico has specifically asserted that Texas’s actions contravene various treaty obligations and has raised humanitarian concerns regarding possible loss of life to persons swimming in the Rio Grande," the proposed injunction added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/abbott-moves-ahead-floating-border-barriers-rio-grande-despite-liberal-outrage" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ABBOTT MOVES AHEAD WITH FLOATING BORDER BARRIERS ON RIO GRANDE DESPITE LIBERAL OUTRAGE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The barrier was installed in July as part of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/greg-abbott" target="_blank"&gt;Abbott's Operation Lone Star,&lt;/a&gt; which is designed to mitigage the broader crisis. Abbott had announced plans for the barrier in June.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Texas officials have stood by their belief that the barrier discourages migrants from crossing the Rio Grande, which is inherently dangerous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Anytime they get in that water, it’s a risk to the migrants," Texas Department of Public Safety director Steve McCraw previously argued. "This is the deterrent from even coming in the water."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Abbott for a statement, but has not heard back.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>No more blurry selfies: How to take better phone pics</title>
      <description>The smartphone people use day to day may be the most powerful camera accessible to you, learn how to utilize its&amp;apos; technological capabilities from a tech expert.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Your fancy smartphone won’t do you much good if it’s dead. &lt;a href="https://www.komando.com/kims-column/smartphone-charging-mistakes-2/861926/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here’s the best way to charge yours&lt;/a&gt;, from a certified tech pro.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One more knowledge drop from me to you: &lt;a href="https://www.komando.com/kims-column/hidden-apps-on-your-smartphone/825914/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Your phone is full of hidden apps and settings&lt;/a&gt;. I’m always surprised developers don’t brag about this stuff more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of us &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/cameras" target="_blank"&gt;take a picture&lt;/a&gt; or video every single day. Make them count with these simple steps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/most-people-make-this-major-mistake-sharing-photos" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOST PEOPLE MAKE THIS MAJOR MISTAKE SHARING PHOTOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When was the last time you did a little upkeep on your phone’s camera?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean your camera lens with a microfiber cloth:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3pQ6ZSl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Inexpensive microfiber cloths&lt;/a&gt; are excellent because they won’t scratch your lenses. Wipe down your front and back cameras to get rid of any fingerprints or debris. Be gentle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get comfortable with your camera specs:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re taking a video of something important, take a minute to switch your camera to 4K if you have it. The same goes for photos. Your phone likely has many optimized modes to take the best pictures, depending on the scenario. Try them out and find the ones you like best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip: &lt;/strong&gt;I love portrait mode for dramatic pictures of pets and little kids. So cute!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;High-quality photos take up a lot of space. If you plan on flexing your photography skills, check your phone’s internal storage. Take a practice photo with the settings you like, then look at the photo file size to get a rough idea of how many you can take before you run out of space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are your phone’s photos backed up? Are you &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt;? &lt;a href="https://www.komando.com/kims-column/save-your-photos/821701/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here’s how to get the job done.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/wait-what-5-amazing-things-you-dont-know-your-phone-can-do" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WAIT, WHAT? 5 AMAZING THINGS YOU DON’T KNOW YOUR PHONE CAN DO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Natural light beats artificial light in nearly every situation. It’s not quite that simple, though. Remember these rules of thumb:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Photographers swear by cloudy days for portraits. There’s still enough light outside to make everyone look nice and bright, but no glaring sun to squint at. Try it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.komando.com/kims-column/look-better-in-photos-2/823163/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Look better in selfies and group pics.&lt;/a&gt; We all want to look our best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Depending on what you’re taking photos of, a tripod can go a long way. It helps you find the perfect height and keeps your phone stable. It might feel like overkill, but tripods &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/us-dollar" target="_blank"&gt;don’t cost much&lt;/a&gt; and genuinely make a difference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/digital-detox-how-put-phone-down-summer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIGITAL DETOX: HOW TO PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN THIS SUMMER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/strong&gt; They’re perfect for group photos. No more leaning your phone against something and hoping it stays up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what that grid option &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/smartphones" target="_blank"&gt;in your smartphone&lt;/a&gt; camera is good for? Nope, you don’t want to center your subject. Instead, use the rule of thirds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a composition guideline that divides your image into a three-by-three grid. All the key elements should be along the lines, not in the middle of a square. This makes for a more balanced, dynamic result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tall subjects such as trees or buildings should appear to meet the top corners of your center box. Smaller subjects should begin with the bottom line of the center box.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Capturing movement is challenging. All the dog owners and parents of small children know what I mean. Burst mode can help. This feature enables your camera &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/photo-gallery" target="_blank"&gt;to take pictures&lt;/a&gt; faster than humanly possible. You get multiple photos for each second and can select your favorites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On just about every smartphone that supports it, you can activate burst mode by holding down the shutter button. Go to your gallery and choose the photo set to see all your shots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;All those pictures take up a lot of space, so just save the best shots from the set.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.komando.com/how-tos/find-and-search-photos/860567/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Phone Photos 201: How to find and search all the images you’ve sent to other people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your tech-know going &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My popular podcast is called "&lt;a href="https://www.komando.com/podcast/kim-komando-explains/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kim Komando Today&lt;/a&gt;."

      <title>Ohio officer fired over K9 attack on surrendering suspect</title>
      <description>Circleville, Ohio Police Officer Ryan Speakman was fired Wednesday after letting his K9 attack suspect Jadarrius Rose, who had begun surrendering before the dog was released.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A police officer in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/ohio" target="_blank"&gt;rural Ohio&lt;/a&gt; was fired Wednesday after he released his police dog on a surrendering truck driver despite state troopers telling him to hold the K9 back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank"&gt;Circleville Police Department&lt;/a&gt; said Ryan Speakman "did not meet the standards and expectations we hold for our police officers" and his termination is "effective immediately." His firing comes a day after the department said he was on paid administrative leave, which is standard during use-of-force investigations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The town's civilian police review board has found Speakman didn’t violate department policy when he deployed the dog, Wednesday’s police statement said, adding that the review board doesn't have the authority to recommend discipline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-officer-paid-leave-prompting-k-9-attack-surrendering-trucker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OHIO OFFICER ON PAID LEAVE AFTER PROMPTING K-9 ATTACK ON SURRENDERING TRUCKER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Department officials said they would have no further comment on the matter "at this time" since it's a personnel matter. Messages seeking comment from Speakman were not immediately returned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Ohio Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, a police union Speakman belongs to, said Wednesday it had filed a grievance on his behalf and that he was fired without just cause.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speakman, who joined the Circleville department in February 2020, deployed his police dog following a lengthy pursuit on July 4 involving the Ohio State Highway Patrol. The episode was captured on a police body camera.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Troopers tried to stop a commercial semitruck that was missing a mudflap and failed to halt for an inspection, according to a highway patrol incident report. The nearby Circleville Police Department was called in to assist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 23-year-old truck driver, Jadarrius Rose of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee" target="_blank"&gt;Memphis, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, initially refused to get out of the truck and later defied instructions to get on the ground, according to the incident report and the body cam video. Rose eventually got on his knees and raised his hands in the air.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The body camera video shows Speakman holding back the K9, and a trooper can be heard off-camera repeatedly yelling, "Do not release the dog with his hands up!" However, Speakman deploys the dog and it can be seen in the video attacking Rose, who yells "Get it off! Please! Please!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-officer-investigation-letting-k9-attack-surrendering-suspect" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OHIO OFFICER UNDER INVESTIGATION AFTER LETTING K9 ATTACK SURRENDERING SUSPECT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rose was treated at a hospital for dog bites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was charged with failure to comply, and hasn't responded to an email sent Monday seeking comment. Attorney Benjamin Partee, who is representing Rose, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not clear why he refused to stop for police. Rose is Black, and Speakman is white. Rose told The Columbus Dispatch that he couldn’t talk about why he didn’t stop. But when asked about the video, told the newspaper: "I’m just glad that it was recorded. What you saw is what, pretty much, happened."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Audio recordings of 911 calls show Rose told emergency dispatchers that the officers pursuing him were "trying to kill" him and he didn’t feel safe pulling over. He also said he was confused about why the officers were trying to stop him and why they had their guns drawn after he briefly stopped the truck before driving away.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ohio police officer fired after K9 attack of surrendering suspect</title>
      <description>The Ohio police officer who deployed a police dog on a truck driver has been fired from the force, authorities said Wednesday.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/ohio" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio police officer&lt;/a&gt; who unleashed a police K9 on a surrendering truck driver following a chase earlier this month has been fired. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Circleville Police Department fired Officer Ryan Speakman following a review of the incident, saying he "did not meet the standards and expectations we hold for our police officers."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Officer Speakman has been terminated from the department, effective immediately," the department said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speakman had been placed on administrative leave after the July 4 incident. He deployed his police dog after a long pursuit that involved troopers with the Ohio State Highway Patrol and ended in Circleville. Both the pursuit and the ensuing attack were captured on a police body camera.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-officer-investigation-letting-k9-attack-surrendering-suspect" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OHIO OFFICER UNDER INVESTIGATION AFTER LETTING K9 ATTACK SURRENDERING SUSPECT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chase began when troopers tried to stop a commercial vehicle semi-truck that was missing a mudflap and failed to halt for an inspection. Circleville authorities were called to assist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The driver, Jadarrius Rose of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Memphis, Tennessee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, refused to get out of the truck and didn't obey instructions to get on the ground, authorities said. Rose, eventually exited the truck and got on his knees with his hands in the air. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The body camera video shows Speakman holding back the K9, and a trooper can be heard off-camera repeatedly yelling, "Do not release the dog with his hands up!" However, Speakman &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-officer-paid-leave-prompting-k-9-attack-surrendering-trucker" target="_blank"&gt;deployed the dog&lt;/a&gt; and it was seen in the video attacking Rose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-sheriff-says-k-9-tackled-burglary-suspect-shot-deputy-times" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLORIDA SHERIFF SAYS K-9 TACKLED BURGLARY SUSPECT WHO SHOT DEPUTY 3 TIMES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A trooper shouted "Get the dog off of him!" Rose appears to be in pain and yells "Get it off! Please! Please!" before the attack ends. Rose was treated at a hospital for dog bites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was charged with failure to comply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shallow Creek Kennels Inc., the Pennsylvania-based police service dog training facility that trained the dog involved in this incident, said its training protocols were followed. Circleville’s canines are being sent to Shallow Creek for evaluation and annual training, the police department said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said the incident should be "a lesson, a wake-up call to everyone that police training in the state of Ohio is not equal."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"While we certainly respect Gov. DeWine’s views and are always ready to discuss how to improve police training, Circleville’s canine teams of dogs and officers are trained and certified to meet current Ohio Peace Officer Training Commission-recognized standards," the police statement said. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

She will receive credit for the 160 days she has already served in the Oakland County Jail, WXYZ-TV reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The crash killed 22-year-old Ben Kable of Shelby Township, who was walking on an Oakland County road before dawn on Jan 1. Kable was home from the university for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/michigan-woman-charged-college-students-death-return-us-fleeing-thailand" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICHIGAN WOMAN CHARGED IN COLLEGE STUDENT'S DEATH TO RETURN TO US AFTER FLEEING TO THAILAND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Howson is a dual U.S. and Thai citizen and left Michigan for Bangkok on Jan. 3.

      <title>Blake Lively steps over rope at Kensington Palace museum exhibit to fix her displayed Met gown</title>
      <description>Blake Lively stepped over the velvet rope at an exhibit in Kensington Palace to fix the dress she wore at the Versace 2022 Met Gala</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Blake Lively took matters into her own hands recently. The actress hopped over a velvet rope meant to keep museum-goers from touching displays to fix a gown she once wore to the Meta Gala that was displayed in the exhibit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"When you’re the clown who hops over the rope at the museum to fix the exhibit," Lively jokingly captioned an Instagram Story video that showed her realigning the dress’ fabric. "Happy almost Virgo season folx."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exhibited dress was a custom Atelier Versace that unraveled from bronze to green as she&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ryan-reynolds-adorable-reaction-blake-lively-2022-met-gala-look" target="_blank"&gt; walked the 2022 Met Gala red carpet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lively’s stunning off-the-shoulder look was inspired by the New York City skyline for the gala’s theme: 'In America: An Anthology of Fashion."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/blake-lively-shows-bikini-body-family-vacation-birth-child" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLAKE LIVELY SHOWS OFF BIKINI BODY ON FAMILY VACATION FOLLOWING BIRTH OF 4TH CHILD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In her video, Lively can be heard telling museum staff, "so you see what the transformation was," as she adjusts the gown's skirt to highlight its attributes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a second post, Lively is seen with jewelry designers Lorraine Schwartz — who was also seen in the first video helping her sort the dress’ fabric — and Ofira Sandberg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"With my sisters," she wrote of the designers as they looked at the crown that completed her Met gala look. "This was absolutely surreal. Seeing this crown that we made in Kensington Palace. I still feel like a kid playing dress up every time I get to wear a gown and borrowed jewels out. To see it memorialized like this… just. Wow. Something I’ll never forget." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a final Story post, Lively showed a closeup of the crown and earrings that went with the dress as Disney's "Once Upon a Dream" from 1959's "Sleeping Beauty" played. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The "A Simple Favor" actress’ dress is displayed among more than 200 others, including Katy Perry’s 2019 Met Gala dress, Beyoncé’s stunning gold dress from the 2017 Grammys and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kendall-jenner-naked-dress-2021-met-gala" target="_blank"&gt;Kendall Jenner’s 2021 Audrey Hepburn&lt;/a&gt;-inspired Givenchy dress at the Met Gala along with several historical royal dresses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/download" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exhibit, in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-william-private-kensington-palace-reception-princess-diana-statue" target="_blank"&gt;Kensington Palace's&lt;/a&gt; State Apartments and Piggott Galleries, "draws fascinating parallels between the world of today’s red carpet and the Georgian Royal Court in the 18th century," according to the Historical Royal Palaces' website. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>White House reveals where it now stands on possible existence of aliens: ‘We don’t know’</title>
      <description>The White House said Wednesday it doesn&amp;apos;t know whether aliens exist, but would continue to investigate the numerous sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The White House revealed Wednesday where it now stands on the possible existence of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/aliens" target="_blank"&gt;alien life&lt;/a&gt;, telling reporters they "don't know" whether the numerous sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) are proof whether extraterrestrials are real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We don't know. We don't have the answers about what these phenomena are," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told a reporter at the daily &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; press briefing who asked if the U.S. government believed there "may be life outside of our planet."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kirby said he didn't have a position on it "one way or the other" that he could immediately speak to, but did say the government believed "there are unexplained aerial phenomena that have been sighted and reported by pilots, Navy and Air Force, that these phenomena have in some cases had an impact on our training ranges, on our pilots' ability to fly, train, operate and stay ready." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ufo-whistleblowers-testify-unknown-objects-far-superior-us-tech-govt-operating-secrecy" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UFO WHISTLEBLOWERS TO TESTIFY UNKNOWN OBJECTS ARE ‘FAR SUPERIOR’ TO US TECH, GOVT ‘OPERATING WITH SECRECY’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"That alone makes it a national security issue worth looking at," he added. "Unidentified aerial phenomena doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but it's an honest assessment of what we think about this problem set. And so we'll see where it goes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier in the briefing, Kirby told another reporter that he had "no information" to provide "one way or the other" on the existence of a "UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program," but admitted the White House takes the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/ufos-what-know-before-congress-holds-historic-hearing-today-non-human-intelligence" target="_blank"&gt;issue of UAPs&lt;/a&gt; seriously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There's a whole office at the Pentagon that is stood up to analyze the data, collect reports, collate those reports and forward them up appropriately. And that's, I think, testament to the fact that we know that in some cases these phenomena have impacted military training, have an impact on military readiness," he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ufo-whistleblower-testifies-his-life-was-threatened-to-hush-up-about-secret-alien-tech-retrieval" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UFO WHISTLEBLOWER TESTIFIES HIS LIFE WAS THREATENED OVER SECRET ALIEN TECH RETRIEVAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reporter pressed Kirby, asking whether &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank"&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; felt claims of the existence of such a program warranted further investigation, and if the White House saw them as credible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If the president didn't believe that the sightings by pilots were serious enough to be considered, he wouldn't have wanted the Pentagon to stand up an office to look at this, to analyze the data, to collect reports and provide a system by which we can collate the information and better figure out what we've got here," Kirby responded. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"But that work is ongoing. So if your question is do we think we need to be transparent with the American people. Of course, we need to be as transparent as we can be. But the truth is, Jeremy, we don't have hard and fast answers on these things. We are trying to get smarter on it," he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ufos-government-hiding-something" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UFOS: IS THE GOVERNMENT HIDING SOMETHING?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kirby's statements come on the same day that the House Oversight Committee held a hearing concerning the sightings of UAPs and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/ufos" target="_blank"&gt;unidentified flying objects&lt;/a&gt; (UFOs), which included testimony from whistleblower David Grusch who testified under oath his life was threatened and that he was instructed to keep quiet about a secret government-run crashed UFO retrieval program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another witness &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/ufo-expert-believes-something-going-airspace-congress-holds-hearing-ufos" target="_blank"&gt;told members of the committee&lt;/a&gt; he believed "something is going on in our airspace."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.com/DOWNLOAD" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News' Chris Eberhart contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Bills’ Josh Allen makes young fan’s day with help from brother: ‘My sister loves you’</title>
      <description>Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen made a young fan&amp;apos;s day at training camp, giving her a hug and signing her jersey. The Bills opened training camp on Wednesday.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/buffalo-bills" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Buffalo Bills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; took the field Wednesday for the first day of training camp, and one young fan had an interaction she won’t forget anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bills-josh-allen-blames-media-overblowing-stefon-diggs-situation-last-month" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quarterback Josh Allen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who is coming off a Pro Bowl selection in 2022, was walking through a horde of fans when a young fan stopped him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"My sister loves you. Can you please hug her or something?" the fan asked Allen as he pointed toward a group of autograph seekers. "She’s right over there in the bucket hat. She's literally crying."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/giants-sign-offensive-lineman-andrew-thomas-record-setting-contract-extension" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;GIANTS SIGN OFFENSIVE LINEMAN ANDREW THOMAS TO RECORD-SETTING CONTRACT EXTENSION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allen then made the young girl's day, giving her a hug before signing her jersey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bills shared a video on Twitter showing the young girl’s reaction after meeting Allen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bills opened training camp on Wednesday at St. John Fisher University in Pittsford, a suburb of Rochester, New York, after failing to reach the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AFC Championship Game&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2022.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It feels like it’s been a long time since we’ve been able to actually go against each other and throw the football around and go full speed," Allen told reporters. "I know OTAs are kind of similar, but it’s not quite this."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bills also received positive news on Wednesday when safety &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bills-damar-hamlin-a-full-go-training-camp-nearly-seven-months-cardiac-arrest" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Damar Hamlin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was declared a "full go" at camp nearly seven months after suffering cardiac arrest during a "Monday Night Football" game against the Cincinnati Bengals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Damar Hamlin is full go here at camp, and we are behind him 100%," head coach Sean McDermott told reporters, per NFL.com. "We'll go at his cadence."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hamlin has made a remarkable recovery after collapsing to the turf after a tackle on Bengals wide receiver &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tee-higgins" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tee Higgins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and needing CPR before an ambulance rushed him to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bills open the 2023 season against the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-jets" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;New York Jets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Sept. 11.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <description>Florida receptionist Angelina Mena was arrested on several charges after police found that she stole credit card information from her employer&amp;apos;s patients, racking up around $44k.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Florida receptionist was arrested after a months-long &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/robbery-theft" target="_blank"&gt;investigation found that she reportedly stole&lt;/a&gt; from her employer's patients, police say,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Angelina Mena was &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime" target="_blank"&gt;arrested on several charges&lt;/a&gt; and booked into the Orange County Jail on Friday, according to Winter Springs Police Department.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mena's employer, MacDonald Family EyeCare in Winter Springs, contacted police on March 11 with suspicions of credit card fraud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"According to the business, the receptionist Angelina Mena was allegedly illegally using patients’ credit card information to commit credit card fraud," the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/WinterSpringsPolice/posts/pfbid02aGPSFmwEZ3RmqcuNWVw28s3bh2bgPuxqJAQcCmUxrskBUwpKMaYdr1nCuVUB4T82l" target="_blank"&gt;Winter Springs Police Department said&lt;/a&gt; in a Facebook post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-burglar-thwarted-elderly-homeowner-held-him-gunpoint-cops" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FLORIDA BURGLAR THWARTED BY ELDERLY HOMEOWNER WHO HELD HIM AT GUNPOINT: COPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Police believe that Mena stole around $44,000 from dozens of patients by taking their credit card information. Mena used a financial services system called Square.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"During the investigation, Winter Springs Police found that Mena used her own Square account to steal approximately $44,000 from 76 patients," the press release added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/shooting-florida-bar-party-leaves-5-wounded-no-arrests" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SHOOTING AT FLORIDA BAR DURING PARTY LEAVES 5 WOUNDED, NO ARRESTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to MacDonald Family EyeCare for a statement, but has not heard back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winter Springs Police Department is actively investigating the incident.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/oklahoma" target="_blank"&gt;Oklahoma judge&lt;/a&gt; is being investigated by a state ethics panel after she was caught on video scrolling through social media and texting during a murder trial, according to video obtained by a local news outlet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lincoln County District Judge Traci Soderstrom was presiding over her first trial for a man accused of fatally beating a 2-year-old when she was captured on surveillance footage checking her Facebook page and searching for a GIF, The Oklahoman reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the seven-day trial in Chandler, about 45 miles northeast of Oklahoma City, the jurist can be seen on the footage using her phone for minutes at a time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A ceiling-mounted security camera captured Soderstrom tapping away as she held the phone in her lap throughout jury selection, opening statements and witness testimony, the outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-judge-parkland-shooter-trial-publicly-reprimanded" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLORIDA JUDGE IN PARKLAND SHOOTER TRIAL PUBLICLY REPRIMANDED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soderstrom, who was elected in November, instructed jurors to turn off all their electronic devices so "they could concentrate on all the evidence" but didn't adopt the same protocol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Khristian Tyler Martzall, 32, was accused of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide" target="_blank"&gt;fatally beating&lt;/a&gt; his girlfriend's toddler, Braxton Danker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the child's mother, Judith Danker, tearfully testified, Soderstrom was allegedly staring at her cellphone screen. Danker was also charged with murder but took a plea deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors asked jurors to find Martzall guilty of first-degree murder, but he was ultimately convicted of second-degree manslaughter after a seven-day trial, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/oklahoma-police-search-duo-accused-killing-several-animals-pet-store" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OKLAHOMA POLICE SEARCH FOR DUO SUSPECTED OF KILLING SEVERAL ANIMALS AT PET STORE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's unclear how the Oklahoman obtained the footage, but it was provided by the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank"&gt;sheriff's office&lt;/a&gt; to the Oklahoma Council on Judicial Complaints as part of its investigation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;District Attorney Adam Panter said he reviewed the video and found that the judge had "spent hours of the trial" on her cellphone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It is both shocking and disappointing," he told the local newspaper. "&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/in-court" target="_blank"&gt;Jurors are banned&lt;/a&gt; from using cellphones in the courtroom during trials because we expect them to give their full time and attention to the evidence being presented. I would expect and hope the court would hold itself to the same standard."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/in-court" target="_blank"&gt;court's administrative director&lt;/a&gt; said judges must abide by the Code of Judicial Conduct, which doesn't specifically mention cellphones. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It does instruct jurists to "act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ryan Reynolds teases Sandra Bullock in birthday message showcasing first nude scene: 'Humiliated and funny'</title>
      <description>Ryan Reynolds shared a clip from his nude scene with Sandra Bullock in &amp;quot;The Proposal&amp;quot; in honor of the actress&amp;apos; 59th birthday. The nude scene was Bullock&amp;apos;s first ever.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ryan Reynolds showcased &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/matt-lauer-to-sandra-bullock-in-2009-interview-i-have-seen-you-naked" target="_blank"&gt;Sandra Bullock's first ever nude scene&lt;/a&gt; in a happy birthday message to the actress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In honor of Bullock's 59th birthday, Reynolds shared a clip &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/betty-white-ryan-reynolds-feud-the-proposal" target="_blank"&gt;from "The Proposal"&lt;/a&gt; in which the two actors accidentally run right into each other's arms while naked. It was the first nude scene Bullock ever did, and she later admitted she only agreed because the moment was meant to be "[humiliating] and funny."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvKa2BdMQ-H/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APP USERS CLICK HERE TO SEE INSTAGRAM POST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Happy Birthday to the inimitable and stunning Sandra Bullock! For your birthday this year, I got us both intimacy coordinators," Reynolds joked on Instagram. "And an HR department. And clothing?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bullock recalled filming the scene and feeling safe with Reynolds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sandra-bullock-break-acting-the-lost-city" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SANDRA BULLOCK EXPLAINS WHY SHE'S TAKING A BREAK FROM ACTING: ‘THAT MAKES ME THE HAPPIEST’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Ryan and I have known each other since we were prepubescent. We go way, way, way back," she said during an episode of the "About Last Night Podcast with Adam Ray" in 2021. "We had to do the naked scene that day and Anne Fletcher, our director who's just incredible, she's great."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We had a closed set, which means no one's allowed to be on there, just hair and makeup coming in to fluff and hide," Bullock recalled. "Ryan and I have these flesh-colored things stuck to our privates, my hair is strategically over the nipples and Ryan's little — not little, at all! It's just whatever's there, and I don't know because I didn't see it. I didn't look!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although both actor's privates were covered for the scene, Bullock recalled a moment where things didn't go as planned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"When they'd say cut, we couldn't really move," she explained. He was on his back with his knees up, and I'm on the floor just sort of resting on his knees, just waiting, and you don't wanna look, and we couldn't really move."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Then, I hear Anne Fletcher from the darkness go, 'Ryan, we can see your ballsack!' I'm like, 'Oh God!' Because you wanna look down, but I'm like, 'Don't look down. Don't look down.' ... Everyone in the darkness spun around to see if they could find a monitor," according to Bullock. "I was like, 'Anne, there's a way to present that information....'"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The "Miss Congeniality" star only agreed to be nude in the scene if she could "be humiliated and funny."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You will not see me trying to attempt being sexy naked — in real life or onscreen. There's just no point in it!" Bullock explained. "It was for that reason, with a friend that you trusted comedically, and safety-wise, I knew I was in the presence of safety."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bullock has since appeared in another nude scene with Channing Tatum in the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sandra-bullock-long-hiatus-break-acting-producing-sxsw-premiere-the-lost-city" target="_blank"&gt;2022 comedy "The Lost City."&lt;/a&gt; While the actress isn't nude, the audience gets a clear shot of Tatum's behind while Bullock proceeds to check for leeches while the two are on a tropical mission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"In all honesty, when you’re down there, and you have two pages of dialogue if you’re looking directly at it, you’ll get nothing done," Bullock told Stephen Colbert of filming the moment. "So I looked at his left thigh."&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hunter Biden plea deal had to end. These are next steps to keep pressure on</title>
      <description>A plea deal negotiated by a team of lawyers for Hunter Biden collapsed on Wednesday. Public outcry over Hunter&amp;apos;s alleged corruption and crimes seems to be finally catching up with him.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a former federal prosecutor, I applaud Delaware District Judge Maryellen Noreika for refusing to participate in the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-plea-deal-appears-fall-apart-first-court-appearance" target="_blank"&gt;Hunter Biden/Justice Department circus&lt;/a&gt; playing out through the "sweetheart deal" as she questioned its legitimacy and deferred her decision on approving any plea deal between Biden and federal prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case against Hunter Biden, the first son of a sitting U.S. president to attempt to plead guilty to federal crimes, has brought to light questions about the fairness and transparency of the Department of Justice and our entire justice system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hunter Biden was ready to plead guilty to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-agrees-plead-guilty-federal-tax-gun-case" target="_blank"&gt;two misdemeanor tax charges&lt;/a&gt; while effectively avoiding prosecution on a gun charge and drug use. This diversion on felony charges was a legal maneuver most Americans would never see if found guilty of similar felony crimes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-plea-deal-appears-fall-apart-first-court-appearance" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUNTER BIDEN PLEADS 'NOT GUILTY' AS PLEA DEAL FALLS APART DURING DELAWARE COURT APPEARANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite behind-closed-doors discussions, both legal teams were at odds on the full scope of the plea deal and whether it would have absolved Hunter Biden of any future prosecution on other crimes. It was surreal to see federal prosecutors disagree with Hunter’s legal team’s understanding of the plea deal. In effect, DOJ prosecutors appear to have taken note of public outcry and scrutiny and took some steps back from Hunter Biden’s future immunity on a decade’s worth of allegedly more serious criminal activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my day as a federal prosecutor, the crimes DOJ would be bringing would be the more serious crimes with serious evidence and guaranteed long prison time going forward. Prosecutors should be looking at possible corruption and racketeering, potential Mann Act and FARA violations, among other serious charges. I’ve been talking for years about existing evidence of a possible pay-to-play scheme involving Biden and his family members and business colleagues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can bet that the recent congressional hearing testimony of FBI and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/irs-whistleblowers-reveal-whos-blame-shocking-biden-corruption" target="_blank"&gt;IRS whistleblowers &lt;/a&gt;and revelations of additional criminal behavior added pressure on DOJ to pursue further charges against Hunter Biden. Simply put, DOJ got caught with a hand in the cookie jar and the only way Americans can hold the government accountable is to keep this pressure on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, DOJ has no significant checks and balances, and for decades, they’ve operated with the idea that they can control both charging and sentencing decisions. Prosecutors very arrogantly believed that they would get this resolution with no repercussions or consequences, but the backlash across this country is putting them on notice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This behavior by DOJ presents fair criticisms of both Attorneys General Bill Barr and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department" target="_blank"&gt;Merrick Garland&lt;/a&gt;. During their tenure as attorneys general, DOJ appears to have been more concerned about protecting the Biden family than actually rooting out corruption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most American families understand that they wouldn't be treated like the Biden's are being treated. While only time will tell if this sweetheart deal will be modified or thrown out of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-biden-first-lady-express-hunter-biden-support-after-not-guilty-pleas-white-house-says" target="_blank"&gt;Judge Noreika’s court&lt;/a&gt;, we must demand that more crimes be thoroughly investigated by a Special Counsel authorized to have full charging authority and unlimited scope to investigate where all evidence leads as it relates to the decades of alleged criminal activity of Hunter Biden, his family members, and associates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We deserve a criminal justice system that upholds transparency, accountability, and justice impartially for every American.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/t/brett-l-tolman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM BRETT TOLMAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Body found at Arizona State Capitol in downtown Phoenix</title>
      <description>Authorities reported Wednesday the discovery of a deceased individual on the premises of the Arizona State Capitol located in downtown Phoenix. An investigation has been launched.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A body was found on the grounds of the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/arizona-democrat-state-lawmaker-censured-after-caught-camera-hiding-bibles" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona State Capitol&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Phoenix, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phoenix police discovered the body just before 7 a.m. Wednesday outside the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/uncontrolled-arizona-wildfire-prompts-hundreds-evacuations-volunteers-door-door-getting-people-out" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNCONTROLLED ARIZONA WILDFIRE PROMPTS HUNDREDS OF EVACUATIONS AS VOLUNTEERS GO DOOR TO DOOR GETTING PEOPLE OUT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Authorities didn’t immediately release any information on the person's identity. They said the Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s Office will &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/stephen-smith-pathologist-has-determined-cause-manner-death-report" target="_blank"&gt;determine the cause of death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investigation was turned over to the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/az-gov-hobbs-announces-new-directors-department-corrections-public-safety" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona Department of Public Safety&lt;/a&gt;, which has jurisdiction over state Capitol property.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Foundation Consumer Healthcare, seller of Plan B One-Step, explores potential $4B sale</title>
      <description>Investors from Foundation Consumer Healthcare, the company that markets the morning-after pill Plan B One-Step, are reportedly exploring the possibility of selling the firm.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Private equity investors of Foundation Consumer Healthcare, which sells popular &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/emergency-contraception-plan-b-unscathed-scotus-reverses-roe-v-wade-report" target="_blank"&gt;morning-after pill Plan B One-Step&lt;/a&gt;, are exploring a potential sale of the company, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company may seek more than $4 billion, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stakeholders, including Kelso &amp;amp; Co. and Juggernaut Capital Partners, are working with financial advisers and are at an early stage of deliberations, which may or may not result in a deal, the report said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/colleges-begin-vending-machines-disperse-morning-pill-more-states-restrict-abortion" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLLEGES BEGIN TO USE VENDING MACHINES TO SELL MORNING-AFTER PILL AS MORE STATES RESTRICT ABORTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The privately-held company, which makes over-the-counter healthcare products, bought &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/university-florida-student-government-oks-plan-b-vending-machines-morning-pill" target="_blank"&gt;Plan B One-Step&lt;/a&gt; and other brands of emergency contraception from Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 2017 for $675 million in cash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kelso, Juggernaut and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/christian-ministry-helps-community-health-care-costs-including-looming-medical-debt" target="_blank"&gt;Foundation Consumer Healthcare&lt;/a&gt; did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Belarusian journalist gets 6 years for covering anti-Lukashenko dissidents</title>
      <description>Belarusian journalist Pavel Mazheika has been sentenced to six years in prison for covering and working for critics of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A prominent journalist &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/belarus" target="_blank"&gt;in Belarus&lt;/a&gt; was sentenced Wednesday to six years in prison, the latest step in a years-long crackdown on opposition figures, independent journalists and human rights activists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On trial in the city of Grodno in western Belarus, Pavel Mazheika, 45, was found guilty of "complicity in extremist activity" for covering the activities of the political opposition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was accused of working for news outlets including Belsat TV, which broadcasts in Belarusian from its base in neighboring Poland. The Belarusian authorities have labeled Belsat as "extremist."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/wagner-mercenaries-train-belarusian-military-lukashenko-says" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WAGNER MERCENARIES TO TRAIN BELARUSIAN MILITARY, LUKASHENKO SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawyer Yuliya Yurhilevich also was sentenced to six years in prison after she was accused of giving Mazheika information on Belarus’ political prisoners, notably on dissident artist Ales Pushkin who died in a Belarusian prison earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yurhilevich, 42, who practiced law for almost 18 years and defended human rights activists, was stripped of her license in February 2022.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This is not a trial, but a theater of the absurd - a journalist and a lawyer are being tried for disseminating information," Mazheika said during the trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mazheika is a well-known figure in Belarus. In 2002, he was sentenced to two years in jail for "slandering the president," before becoming press secretary for presidential candidate Alyaksandr Milinkevich in 2006.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mazheika has since worked for leading independent news outlets in both Belarus and Poland, hosting several shows and acting as executive director for Belsat TV.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The journalist has spent 11 months behind bars since his arrest in August 2022. Earlier, Mazheika said that during his detention he was severely beaten by &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank"&gt;law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; officers, and accused them of trying to gouge out his eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya is among those who have condemned Mazheika’s and Yurhilevich’s sentencing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/belarusian-artist-dumped-manure-outside-lukashenkos-office-dies-prison-according-wife" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BELARUSIAN ARTIST WHO DUMPED MANURE OUTSIDE LUKASHENKO'S OFFICE DIES IN PRISON, ACCORDING TO HIS WIFE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Today, brave journalist Pavel Mazheika and lawyer Yulia Yurhilevich were sentenced to six years in prison in another mockery of justice in Belarus," she said. "This is a blatant attack on those who dare to speak the truth. Journalists and lawyers are persecuted for carrying out their profession."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Journalists and activists in Belarus have faced large-scale repression since the August 2020 vote that handed a sixth term to President Alexander Lukashenko. Following the election, which was rejected as fraudulent by the opposition and the West, Belarus was swept by massive protests, some of which drew more than 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Authorities responded with a brutal crackdown. More than 35,000 people were arrested, thousands were beaten by police while in custody, and dozens of nongovernmental organizations and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank"&gt;independent media outlets&lt;/a&gt; were shut down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some 1,481 recognized political prisoners are currently behind bars in Belarus, according to the Viasna human rights center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hunter Biden went from ‘sweetheart deal’ to ‘poison pill:’ legal experts break down derailed plea deal</title>
      <description>Legal experts weigh in on Hunter Biden&amp;apos;s legal fate after plea deal with Justice Department fell apart in court on Tuesday.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Biden's son left federal court Wednesday after his pre-arranged plea deal with the Justice Department (DOJ) fell apart after surprising revelations that Hunter Biden is still under investigation for possible &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/emails-to-hunter-biden-show-plans-to-meet-with-state-department-officials-about-burisma-probe" target="_blank"&gt;Foreign Agents Registration Act&lt;/a&gt; (FARA) crimes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-plea-deal-appears-fall-apart-first-court-appearance" target="_blank"&gt;Hunter Biden&lt;/a&gt; was expected to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax counts of willful failure to pay federal income tax as part of a plea deal to avoid jail time on a felony gun charge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Judge Maryellen Noreika did not accept the plea agreement, questioning its constitutionality and the broad immunity Hunter Biden would have received, leading Hunter Biden to plead "not guilty" instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Criminal prosection experts say that the younger Biden went from "a sweetheart deal" to a "real poison pill" that could "expose him across the board."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-plea-deal-appears-fall-apart-first-court-appearance" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HUNTER BIDEN PLEADS 'NOT GUILTY' AS PLEA DEAL FALLS APART DURING DELAWARE COURT APPEARANCE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The judge had an obligation to make sure that the defendant and the government have a very clear idea of what is implicated guaranteed," Jonathan Turley, criminal law professor at George Washington University, told Fox News, adding that "they didn't have that."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turley said the plea deal dissolving in such a manor is "extremely rare" akin to "a wedding where both the groom and bride object."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hunter Biden, 53, has been under federal investigation since 2018. That investigation into his "tax affairs" began amid the discovery of suspicious activity reports that related to money from "China and other foreign nations." IRS whistleblowers said the investigation began as an offshoot from an existing probe into a foreign pornography platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hunter was expected to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of willful failure to pay more than $1 million in federal income tax in exchange for immunity from other crimes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was also expected to enter into a pretrial diversion agreement for a separate felony charge of possession of a firearm – an element of which Noreika expressed questions of constitutionality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-agrees-plead-guilty-federal-tax-gun-case" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HUNTER BIDEN AGREES TO PLEAD GUILTY TO FEDERAL TAX CHARGES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turley said the "sweetheart deal" was an effort to "cap off" the years-long federal probe into Hunter Biden's taxes and foreign business dealings. "But now, it’s the worst possible situation for Hunter Biden," Turley said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turley said Biden "doesn't have any protection at all" and that the Department of Justice is in a position where they can bring to bear any or all of the remaining counts, including FARA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"And they usually do," Turley said. When a defendant "goes south" on a plea deal, the DOJ usually "puts everything on the table for a potential trial."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jim Trusty, criminal prosecutor and former lawyer for former President Donald Trump, said the plea deal breakdown was unusual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-allegedly-paid-5-million-by-burisma-executive" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;EXCLUSIVE: JOE BIDEN ALLEGEDLY PAID $5M BY BURISMA EXECUTIVE AS PART OF BRIBERY SCHEME, ACCORDING TO FBI DOCUMENT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Up until today, Delaware was looking like the place where investigations go to die," Trusty told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But DOJ attorneys reiterated to the judge that there is an "ongoing investigation" surrounding Hunter Biden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At one point the judge asked DOJ prosecutor Leo Wise, "Is there an ongoing investigation here?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wise answered that "there is" but said he couldn’t tell the judge what the investigation was into. When she asked if the government could potentially bring a FARA charge, Wise answered, "Yes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/download" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"What we found out from statements that DOJ lawyers made in open court is that Hunter is still under investigation, that he faces potential liability and that there was nothing in the plea deal or offer that would provide him with immunity against future prosecution on those grounds," former federal prosecutor Will Scharf told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scharf said that a likely next-step scenario is that a new plea deal will be put in place that will be limited to crimes within the jurisdiction of the District of Delaware, namely the tax crimes, gun and drug charges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I think Hunter is just going to have to eat that and accept that he will continue to be under investigation for FARA," he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Hunter is not out of the water. He is in a lot of trouble. And the situation is going to continue to develop. Today was, I think, in Hunter's mind, supposed to be the end. And instead, he found out he's really pretty close to the beginning," Scharf added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>EBay billionaire who supported defund the police movement poised to cash in on private security investments</title>
      <description>Business is booming for security guards, says the owner of one private security company, bolstered in part by the defund the police movement and its supporters.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The billionaire founder of eBay lavished money on activist groups calling for law enforcement to be defunded or abolished wholesale, while also investing heavily in private security startups, according to an independent journalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The idea of ‘defund the police for everybody else, but I have the resources to be able to pay to have your own private security around you 24/7,’ it’s very hypocritical," said Brett Christenson, who recently started his own security company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/liberal-university-disarmed-police-2020-riots-now-reversing-course" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS LIBERAL UNIVERSITY DISARMED ITS POLICE AFTER THE 2020 RIOTS. NOW THEY'RE REVERSING COURSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pierre Omidyar, whose wealth Bloomberg values at $9.81 billion, showered money on anti-police groups following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, according to &lt;a href="https://www.leefang.com/p/billionaire-funding-abolish-the-police" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;independent journalist Lee Fang&lt;/a&gt;. In June 2020, foundations connected to the billionaire &lt;a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-networks-statement-reflecting-and-responding-to-injustice/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;announced donations&lt;/a&gt; of $500,000 to organizations "on the frontlines fighting to protect and advance Black lives."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Movement for Black Lives, for example, received around $300,000 from the Omidyar Network that year, tax records show. The "abolitionist" organization promotes the dissolution of police, prisons and "all other institutions that inflict violence on Black people," according to its website.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"When we say ‘defund and abolish the police,’ we mean exactly that," Movement for Black Lives wrote in a &lt;a href="https://m4bl.org/statements/bidens-plan-stimulus-money-funding-police/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;past press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Omidyar Network donated a further $1.3 million to two other organizations to sponsor the website DefundPolice.org, Fang reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Omidyar was privately investing in companies capitalizing on the growing demand for security services. Bond, a New York-based company that bills itself as the Uber for bodyguards, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uber-like-bodyguard-on-demand-service-launched-by-bond-nationwide-301161405.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;listed Omidyar&lt;/a&gt; as one of its main investors. Bond referenced &lt;a href="https://www.ourbond.com/what-is-personal-security-in-todays-world/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;"civil unrest"&lt;/a&gt; and rising crime in its 2020 marketing materials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Omidyar also invested in the AI-based security camera system Deep Sentinel, according to Fang. Deep Sentinel's vice president of marketing &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/bay-area-residents-turn-artificial-intelligence-stop-crime-amid-burglary-surge-police-shortages" target="_blank"&gt;told Fox News&lt;/a&gt; business "has just skyrocketed in the past year."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Omidyar Network did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/digital-originals" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rep. Cori Bush paid big bucks for private security while calling for cuts to police budgets. &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cori-bush-campaign-continues-shell-thousands-dollars-husband-private-security" target="_blank"&gt;Her campaign funneled&lt;/a&gt; tens of thousands of dollars to her husband for private security this year, and in 2021 the Missouri Democrat was asked about her spending on personal protection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Suck it up, and defunding the police has to happen," Bush said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The private security industry has been booming in the United States, with security guard employment spiking after the 9/11 attacks and rising again in the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The industry is absolutely growing," Christenson said. "With the defund the police movement, that's put a big strain on public services for safety."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christenson started Iron Goat Defense after a 20-year career in the Coast Guard, working primarily in counter drug operations in Central and South America, as well as counterterrorism and piracy operations in Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I was not happy with the quality of the security guards you would see out in the public eye typically," Christenson said. He started the San Diego-based company with the goal of providing "a better trained, better quality of guard."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nc-tourist-town-rocked-violence-wake-defund-police-movement-rolls-out-plan-combat-rise-crime" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NC TOURIST TOWN ROCKED BY VIOLENCE IN WAKE OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT ROLLS OUT PLAN TO COMBAT RISE IN CRIME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Private security guards outnumber &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank"&gt;uniformed police&lt;/a&gt; by more than 40%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There were an &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes339032.htm#ind" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; 1,124,890 security guards across America last year, a 6.7% increase from 2020. Meanwhile, there are an estimated 655,890 police and sheriff's patrol officers, though that excludes some law enforcement positions, like detectives and specialty police such as game wardens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christenson said the defund the police movement and political rhetoric have contributed to ongoing law enforcement staffing shortages and, as a result, longer response times. He sees private security guards as both a deterrent to crime and a safety net when police are slow to respond to an emergency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You have the guard there on site and as long as they are well-trained, they can act immediately and potentially save many lives just by being right there on scene," he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christenson doesn't anticipate the trend toward private security reversing anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"People are getting tired of their businesses being robbed, broken into, vandalized," Christenson said, adding that executive protection — where an agent protects specific individuals — is also becoming more lucrative. "The money's definitely increasing and people are willing to pay it."&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Top US Army Garrison West Point officer suspended pending investigation</title>
      <description>The head of West Point U.S. Army garrison has been suspended for unspecified alleged conduct that is being investigated.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A top commander at the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/us-army" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Army Garrison West Point&lt;/a&gt; has been suspended, officials said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Military Academy's Public Affairs Office confirmed the suspension of Col. Anthony Bianchi with Fox News Digital but did not provide further details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"U.S. Army Garrison West Point Commander has been suspended of his duties for alleged conduct pending the outcome of an investigation," it said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/wokeness-politicization-military-alarming-warns-rep-michael-waltz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘WOKENESS,’ POLITICIZATION OF THE MILITARY ‘ALARMING,’ WARNS REP. MICHAEL WALTZ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bianchi, from &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida" target="_blank"&gt;Tampa, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, took command of the U.S. Army Garrison West Point last year. He was commissioned as a field artillery officer from West Point in 1997," according to his biography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also played Army football. He deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan during his career. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;West Point recently drew attention from Capitol Hill when some Republicans demanded answers from the military academy over the school’s role-play exercise for cadets on "respecting the pronouns people prefer."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Republican &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/rep-michael-waltz"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reps. Michael Waltz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Florida and Jim Banks of Indiana sent a letter to West Point superintendent Lt. Gen. Steve Gilland regarding a leaked "facilitator guide" for role-play exercises involving academy cadets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Republicans celebrated Wednesday after &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/hunter-biden" target="_blank"&gt;Hunter Biden’s plea deal&lt;/a&gt; fell apart during a dramatic courtroom moment, and lawmakers declared that "justice is coming" for the president’s son.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He had been expected to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax counts of willful failure to pay federal income tax as part of a plea deal to avoid jail time on a felony gun charge during a court appearance in Wilmington, Delaware.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-plea-deal-appears-fall-apart-first-court-appearance" target="_blank"&gt;Judge Maryellen Noreika&lt;/a&gt; did not accept the plea agreement, questioning the constitutionality of the deal, specifically the diversion clause and the immunity Hunter Biden would receive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also clashed with Hunter Biden’s lawyer about potential future charges as they confirmed he is still under federal investigation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-plea-deal-appears-fall-apart-first-court-appearance" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUNTER BIDEN PLEADS ‘NOT GUILTY’ AS PLEA DEAL FALLS APART DURING DELAWARE COURT APPEARANCE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Judge Noreika said the diversion agreement, which meant the government wouldn’t charge Hunter Biden with a more serious gun charge if he pleaded to the tax charges, might be unconstitutional. That would mean the entire plea deal would be unconstitutional, meaning Hunter Biden would not be getting the immunity he sought. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Mr. Biden, I know you want to get this over with, and I’m sorry," Noreika said. "But I need to get more information to do justice as I’m required to do."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-agrees-plead-guilty-federal-tax-gun-case" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HUNTER BIDEN AGREES TO PLEAD GUILTY TO FEDERAL TAX CHARGES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Republicans who have sought to tie Hunter Biden’s actions to his father delighted in the move, with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/c/rep-james-comer" target="_blank"&gt;Oversight Committee Chair James Comer&lt;/a&gt; declaring the judge "did the right thing by refusing to rubber-stamp Hunter Biden’s sweetheart plea deal."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"But let’s be clear: Hunter’s sweetheart plea deal belongs in the trash," Comer, R-Ky., said. "Last week, we heard from two credible IRS whistleblowers about the Department of Justice’s politicization and misconduct in the Biden criminal investigation. Today, the Department of Justice revealed Hunter Biden is under investigation for being a foreign agent."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., also celebrated the move, saying, "You never know what is going to happen in a typical day in D.C.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-allegedly-paid-5-million-by-burisma-executive" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;EXCLUSIVE: JOE BIDEN ALLEGEDLY PAID $5M BY BURISMA EXECUTIVE AS PART OF A BRIBERY SCHEME, ACCORDING TO FBI DOCUMENT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If they throw the plea deal out, they’ll have to reposition and decide if they’re going to go to trial or how they’re going to proceed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If I were you, go home tonight, get yourself a big old bowl of popcorn and a big old glass of ice tea … and it’s going to be a long night."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., had a message directly for Hunter Biden on "America’s Newsroom."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If you are watching this right now, you are not above the law and justice is coming for you today," said Mace, who also hinted at future oversight from Republicans in Congress. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of questions at this point, but it looks like he’s being investigated, and we want to know why."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank"&gt;White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre&lt;/a&gt; delivered a statement at the beginning of her daily briefing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Hunter Biden is a private citizen, and this was a personal matter for him. As we have said, the president, the first lady, they love their son. And they support him as he continues to rebuild his life," Jean-Pierre said. "This case was handled independently, as all of you know, by the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department" target="_blank"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of a prosecutor appointed by the former president, President Trump.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"So for anything further, as you know, and we've been very consistent from here, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice and to Hunter's representatives who is his legal team, obviously, who can address any of your questions." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Brooke Singman and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Buffalo medical school hit with civil-rights complaint over summer program that prefers non-White applicants</title>
      <description>The Equal Protection Project filed a federal civil-rights complaint against SUNY&amp;apos;s Buffalo School of Medicine&amp;apos;s summer program that give preference to non-White students.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An advocacy group has filed a federal &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology/culture" target="_blank"&gt;civil-rights complaint&lt;/a&gt; against the State University of New York’s Buffalo School of Medicine for running two summer programs that give preference to non-White students and requires White students to prove that they are either "economically disadvantaged or historically underrepresented."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;State University of New York’s (SUNY's) Buffalo School of Medicine Medical Science Technology Entry Program (STEP) for &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/high-school" target="_blank"&gt;high school students&lt;/a&gt;; and its Middle School Summer Enrichment Program for 7th and 8th graders give preferential treatment to high school and middle school students who identify as "Black/African-American," "American Indian/Alaska Native" and "Hispanic/ Latino."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a July 25 complaint, &lt;a href="https://equalprotect.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;the Equal Protection Project&lt;/a&gt; (EPP) told the U.S. Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights that the racial preference program violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment as well as Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"SUNY Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine is a quality institution that has strong anti-discrimination policies consistent with legal requirements. SUNY Buffalo should live up to its own standards and the law and stop treating people differently based on race and color," William Jacobson, president of the EPP, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The university's STEP program "is a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york" target="_blank"&gt;New York State&lt;/a&gt; grant-funded program that prepares secondary school students (in grades 7 to 12) who are either economically disadvantaged or historically underrepresented for entry into college and improves their participation rate in mathematics, science, technology, health-related fields and the licensed professions."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyu-opens-anti-racist-class-only-white-public-school-parents-report"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYU OPENS ANTI-RACIST CLASS ONLY TO WHITE PUBLIC SCHOOL PARENTS: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In its admission eligibility requirements process, both summer programs require every applicant to identify their race and ethnicity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its STEP program states &lt;a href="https://www.nysed.gov/postsecondary-services/science-and-technology-entry-program-step" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt; that the program is designed for "minorities historically underrepresented in the scientific, technical, health related and licensed professions who are African American, American Indian/Alaska Native or Hispanic." The program defines "African Americans" as those who are "black," and includes those who are "from Africa and the Caribbean."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both applications state that students who do not fall into the racial or ethnic categories must demonstrate that they are "economically disadvantaged" in order to be eligible to participate in the college's summer program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The school did not respond to Fox News' requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The University at Buffalo also promotes the Medical Science STEP program on its website and has an online application form for students to complete. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the application form, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college" target="_blank"&gt;the University of Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; also makes it clear that if applicants are not racial minorities they are automatically excluded from consideration unless they can demonstrate that they are low-income, the complaint says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The EPP alleges that the summer programs violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires states to practice equal protection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/temple-u-host-philly-fatcon-queer-sex-therapist-offering-fat-positive-sexual-healthcare"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEMPLE U TO HOST PHILLY ‘FATCON’ WITH QUEER SEX THERAPIST OFFERING ‘FAT POSITIVE SEXUAL HEALTHCARE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jacobson said that the program is teaching the younger generation that "treating people differently based on race and color is acceptable."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"By implementing racially discriminatory policies with regard to high school and middle school student programs, SUNY Buffalo is doing damage beyond the institution," Jacobson said. "It is teaching youth that treating people differently based on race and color is acceptable."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"But such discrimination never is acceptable, and SUNY Buffalo needs to lead by example," Jacobson continued.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In its formal complaint, the EPP asked that the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights to "impose remedial relief as the law permits for the benefit of those who have been illegally excluded" from the SUNY summer programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The Equal Protection Project calls upon SUNY to conduct a system-wide Equality Audit to identify all programming that discriminates on the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/good-riddance-affirmative-action" target="_blank"&gt;basis of race&lt;/a&gt; and color, and to eliminate those practices," Jacobson said. "As the Supreme Court recently ruled, 'Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it.'" &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://equalprotect.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;EqualProtect.org&lt;/a&gt; is willing to assist SUNY in an Equality Audit without charge," Jacobson added.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
